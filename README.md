# Sora's garden ðŸ¦Š

Just a cozy corner of mine, where I want to write about my knowledge, whether it is technical or not.

This website is automatically deployed [via GitHub Pages](.github/workflows/jekyll.yml) to [garden.heysora.net](https://garden.heysora.net). It runs [Jekyll 4](https://jekyllrb.com).  
I'm currently using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write my notes, and [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) to edit the site's code.
