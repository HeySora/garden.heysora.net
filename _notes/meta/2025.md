### Damn.
It's been two years since I let myself spend time writing. Quite frankly, I regret it, but 2025 is my year, and I'm tired of letting it slip.

A lot has happened since 2023. Mostly terrible stuff, sadly, but I'm not here to think about that, as my mistake for those two years was allocating too much time to undeserving people instead of focusing on myself. In consequence, however, writing is one of the healthy things I put on the side.

As I mentioned in [[garden-origins|this garden's origins]], I wanted to focus on writing more *because of* how much time I spend writing to individual people. As such, I completely missed the mark about whom you should be writing things for: **yourself**.  
Evidently, it is undeniable that doing so for others [[garden-plans|still is okay]], but taking yourself out of the equation is where the error lies, and I failed to assess that when I needed it the most.

So, let me start again.

### A *lot* has happened since 2023:
- I visited the US for the first time! That really was something.
- A handful of friends have visited my place, making it their first time visiting Switzerland as well.
- I went through a lot of new video games! Many of these left quite an impact on me, namely [Void Stranger](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2121980/Void_Stranger/), [ZeroRanger](https://store.steampowered.com/app/809020/ZeroRanger/), [OMORI](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/), [Chicory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123450/Chicory_A_Colorful_Tale/), and [UFO 50](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/).
- Spent a lot more time outside, walking in my city as well as traveling all across Switzerland and France mostly.
- Balatro. ![Image frequently used by the Balatro account, of a person with clown disguise.](/assets/2025/balatro.jpg){: .emote }
- I made a lot of progress appreciating the way I look!! I still have to get new clothes, but I'm sure that'll come soon.
- I spend less time on [[social-medias-poison|social media]].
- And ultimately, for the last few months, I've been expanding my knowledge and strengthening my toolset. I'm now notably familiar with [FNA](https://fna-xna.github.io) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

Overall, all of this represents a lot of fond memories. And, if I may be honest here, I'll admit that writing these lines definitely helps to feel a bit better about those two years.  
Wanting to *truly* be myself adding seeds in this garden does **not** mean I'm going to talk about the bad stuff either. I spent way too much mental bandwidth dealing with undeserving people, to the point of having impacted other relationships. This truthfully is my biggest regret of those last two years.

But 2025 is my year. I'm not neglecting self-care anymore, and so far my progress this year has already had very noticeable positive effects. One of the things I'm committing to is to catch up on the time I owe this garden. It felt good writing this note. I feel more enthusiastic compared to keeping this all in my mind, and I'm not done writing for today.

2025 is a new beginning. :3
