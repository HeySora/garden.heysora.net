There's so much I want to write about that it's really hard to pick what to start with. Even in the context of [[garden-origins|a digital garden]], where you don't have to finish a note you're working on... *you still have to start somewhere.*

As a start, I asked a few friends about which topics I'm knowledgeable about, and/or topics they would enjoy reading if I wrote about them (without talking about this digital garden yet). Here are all the responses:
- **[[web-optimisations|Code Optimisation in Web]]**: How to optimize groundbreaking experiences and keep those running well. *â€” Shinu*{: .nobr}
- **How to make in-game downloadable content**: Explaining the basics of serving additional assets for a game over the web, and optionally securing the transfer. *â€” Ky_Dash*{: .nobr}
- **How Cloud infrastructures work**: How environments such as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) can be used to migrate off your own monoserver to a much more convenient infrastructure. *â€” oatmealine*{: .nobr}
- **My process behind making Web design**: How do I start from nothing and end up with a website with neat effects and backgrounds without sacrificing UX. *â€” TaroNuke*{: .nobr}
- **Webserver configuration**: How components such as *PHP-FPM* or *node.js* servers can interact with servers such as *nginx* or *Apache*, and my tips to properly configure those. *â€” CERiNG*{: .nobr}
- ***"anything you say about PHP"***: ...Alright! I'll do my best for that one! *â€” XeroOl*{: .nobr}
- **Tips to make websites with dynamic contents without pulling your hair**: What's my own way of doing dynamic websites with as little hassle as possible. *(Hint: it does not involve much JS)* *â€” Aura*{: .nobr}

This experience has been very useful to get some base ideas (thanks everyone ðŸ§¡). Here are a few additional topics I might write about:
- **Why is it so hard to change your ways of doing things**: And talking about my experiences trying to switch to new software.
- **My experience with Home Assistant**: A smart home is really freakin' cool when you actually make it useful instead of gimmicky, and it's tougher to reach than you might think.
- **Respecting users' privacy as a website administrator**: Best practises to gain people's trust and not be an asshole.
- **How to make macOS bearable**: My personal collection of tools, tricks, and scripts to make efficient workflows.
- **[[social-medias-poison|Social media and their actual social aspect fading away]]**: How bad they became and how to keep yourself in a great shape.
- **My Code Golfing experience**: My own experience writing insanely short code for fun.

There will very, *very* likely be new notes appearing before some of the ideas here. Some of these ideas might even be scrapped completely!

Who knows how this garden will grow. âœ¨
